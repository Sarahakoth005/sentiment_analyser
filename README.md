I Used FLET to create a Sentiment Analyzer.

## What is a Sentiment Analyzer
A SentimentAnalyzer is a tool to implement and facilitate Sentiment Analysis tasks using NLTK features and classifiers, especially for teaching and demonstrative purposes.

**Sentiment Analysis**
Sentiment analysis is the practice of using algorithms to classify various samples of related text into overall positive and negative categories. With NLTK, you can employ these algorithms through powerful built-in machine learning operations to obtain insights from linguistic data.
## Applications of Sentiment Analysis
From a business point of view, sentiment analysis presents a way of automatically monitoring “what people are saying” without ever having actually read anything. For example, it can be used for:

**Product review monitoring** – monitoring which of your products receive a higher rate of positive comments

**Market research** – discovering attitudes of internet users toward the research target

**Search engines/recommender systems** – enhancing performance by better understanding what users meant by the content of a query
